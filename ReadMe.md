**Week 1:** In Week 1, I built the foundation of the TalentView project by cleaning and modeling HR data and creating a Workforce Overview dashboard with key KPIs and employee demographics.
**Week 2:** In Week 2, the focus was on employee attrition analysis. I created key attrition metrics and designed an Attrition Analysis dashboard to track attrition rate trends, separation types (voluntary vs involuntary), and the main reasons employees are leaving.
**Week 3 – Hiring Analysis & AI Insights**
In Week 3, the focus was on analyzing hiring efficiency and understanding workforce hiring patterns. A Hiring Analysis dashboard was built to track new hires, average time-to-hire, and hiring pipeline stages. Additionally, Power BI’s AI Key Influencers visual was used to identify key drivers of voluntary attrition, providing deeper, data-driven insights for HR decision-making.
