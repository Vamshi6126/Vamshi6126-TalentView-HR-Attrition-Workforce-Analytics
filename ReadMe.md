**Week 1:** In Week 1, I built the foundation of the TalentView project by cleaning and modeling HR data and creating a Workforce Overview dashboard with key KPIs and employee demographics.
**Week 2:** In Week 2, the focus was on employee attrition analysis. I created key attrition metrics and designed an Attrition Analysis dashboard to track attrition rate trends, separation types (voluntary vs involuntary), and the main reasons employees are leaving.
